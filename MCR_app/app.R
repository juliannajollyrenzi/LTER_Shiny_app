about.txt <- "The Mo'orea Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site is a reserach site that was established by the U.S. National Science Foundation to gain understanding of long term dynamics in coral reef ecosystems. 
The Mo'orea LTER is part of a network of LTERs across the world that take repeated measurements each year to observe ecological changes over time. 
In Mo'orea, researchers have been observing a diverse suite of corals, non-coral invertebrates, fishes, and algae for nearly two decades, in addition to measuring changes in physical water properties such as temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations."

where.txt <- "Mo'orea is a tropical island in French Polynesia. Mo'orea is a part of the Society Islands, which is a volcanic island group in the Pacific that includes Tahiti, Bora Bora, and Tetiaroa.
Mo'orea is surrounded by coral reefs, which can be divided into different habitats based on their proximity to land (Figure 2, bottom). 
Coral reefs directly bordering the island are termed fringing reefs, which are usually separated from backreefs by deeper water. 
After the backreef (moving away from land) the coral forms a peak where waves break, termed the reef crest. 
Over the reef crest the water gets deeper. The corals on the ocean-side of the reef crest makeup the forereef (or 'outer' reef). 
The Mo'orea LTER collects data in all of these habitats, including at two different depths on the forereef (fringing, backreef, forereef/outer 10m, and forereef/outer 17m).
Researchers regularly survey all of four these habitats at six different sites around the island: LTER 1 and 2 (northern shore), LTER 3 and 4 (southeastern shore), and LTER 5 and 6 (southwestern shore)."

data.txt <- "We use data that are freely available on the Mo'orea LTER website (http://mcrlter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/topic/; downloaded Jan 2021). 
We focus on three core datasets: annual surveys of benthic organisms (i.e. species that live on the bottom, such as algae and sponges) [2]; 
annual surveys of non-coral invertebrates, such as sea urchins and snails [3]; and annual surveys of hard corals [4].
We create interactive visualizations of each of these time series, which we hope will inspire questions for further research and make the Mo'orea LTER data more accessible."

## Create theme----
mcr_theme <- bs_theme(
    bootswatch = "journal",
    base_font = font_google("Helvetica"),
    heading_font = font_google("Helvetica"),
    headings_color = "#fd5d5e"
)

## User interface----
ui <- fluidPage(theme = mcr_theme, # fluid page means it changes when you expand/contract it. theme is for the CSS in the www subfolder

## Run app----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)





### NOTE: to start do this:
# make a user interface
#ui <- fluidPage()

# create a reactive dataset to use in the server

# make a server for creating outputs from ui
#server <- function(input, output) {}

#shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
